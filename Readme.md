# Feature extraction on UMD Dataset

There are 4 notebooks:

- umd-feature-extractor.ipynb

This notebook is to run pretrained model on the UMD images to get high dimensional features.

- autoencoder-on-umd-features.ipynb

This notebook is to run autoencoder on the high dimensional features to get low dimensional features.

- tsne-on-umd-features.ipynb

This notebook is to run t-SNE on the low dimensional features to have a 2-d visualization.

- blend_images.ipynb

This notebook is to blend two classes images.

*We will use low dimensional features.*
